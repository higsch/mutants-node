## Do you want to plot yourself?

You need to have [Node](https://nodejs.dev) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. Then clone the repo and get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/higsch/mutants-node.git
cd mutants-node

npm install
npm run start
```

There is a `config.js` file where you can adjust the plotting settings. Have fun!
